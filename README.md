### Hiya! 👋

I am a self-taught homelabber and open-source advocate with a background in technology 💡 and writing 📝. I have been active in the [**Home Assistant** 🏠](https://github.com/home-assistant) community since March 2015 and am proficient in **YAML** and learning **Kubernetes**. My main focus is on improving my smart home and finding new ways to contribute to the tech community.

If you are interested in collaborating on projects or discussing tech topics, feel free to reach out to me! I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow in the tech industry.
